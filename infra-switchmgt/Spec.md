Technical Specification: NetView Cisco Configuration AnalyzerVersion: 2.0 (SLG/Honeycomb Edition)Date: 2026-01-20Status: Active Development1. Executive SummaryNetView is a client-side, Single Page Application (SPA) designed for Network Engineers to visualize and analyze Cisco IOS configuration files. The application parses raw text configurations, extracts structured data (Interfaces, IP addresses, Hostnames), and automatically generates an interactive network topology diagram.Key Differentiator: The application operates entirely offline (client-side), ensuring sensitive network data never leaves the user's local machine. It features a "Gamified" (SLG-style) visualization mode using hexagonal nodes.2. System Architecture2.1 Technical StackCore Language: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).Framework: None (Vanilla JS).Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for utility-first responsive design.Visualization Engine: Vis.js Network (via CDN) for canvas-based graph rendering.Storage: * localStorage (Browser) for session persistence.JSON Blob (File System) for project export/import.Runtime Environment: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). No backend server required.2.2 Application StructureThe application adheres to a Single-File Architecture pattern (index.html).Presentation Layer: HTML DOM with Tailwind classes.Logic Layer: Embedded <script> block containing parsing logic, state management, and event handlers.Data Layer: In-memory AppState object synced to LocalStorage.3. Data Design3.1 Global State (AppState)The application maintains a centralized state object:const AppState = {
    devices: [],      // Array of Device Objects
    visNetwork: null  // Instance of Vis.js Network
};
3.2 Device Object ModelEach parsed configuration file is transformed into the following JSON structure:{
  "id": "string (unique identifier, e.g., 'dev_1729384...')",
  "filename": "string (original filename)",
  "hostname": "string (extracted from 'hostname' command)",
  "type": "enum ('Switch', 'Firewall', 'WLC')",
  "createdAt": "ISO8601 Date String",
  "raw": "string (full original text content)",
  "interfaces": [
    {
      "name": "string (e.g., 'GigabitEthernet1/0/1')",
      "ip": "string (IPv4 address) or null",
      "mask": "string (Subnet mask) or null",
      "desc": "string (Interface description) or ''",
      "shutdown": "boolean"
    }
  ]
}
4. Functional Specifications & Algorithms4.1 Parsing EngineInput: Raw text string from .txt, .cfg, or .log files.Logic: Regex-based line-by-line iteration.Hostname Extraction: Case-insensitive match for ^\s*hostname\s+([^\s]+).Device Type Detection:If hostname contains "FW" or "ASA" → Type: FirewallIf hostname contains "WLC" → Type: WLCDefault → Type: SwitchInterface Parsing:Detect block start: ^\s*interface\s+(.+)Extract IP: ^ip\s+address\s+(\d+\.\.\.)\s+(\d+\.\.\.)Extract Description: ^description\s+(.+)Detect State: shutdown keyword implies down.4.2 Topology Generation AlgorithmThe application automatically draws connections (Edges) between Devices (Nodes) based on two heuristics, prioritized in order:Layer 3 Subnet Matching (High Confidence):Logic: Convert IP and Mask to Binary/Integer.Formula: (IP_A & Mask_A) === (IP_B & Mask_B) AND Mask_A === Mask_B.Result: Creates an edge labeled with interface names and IP addresses.Layer 1/2 Description Matching (Medium Confidence):Logic: String inclusion check.Formula: Interface_Description_A contains Hostname_B OR Interface_Description_B contains Hostname_A.Result: Creates an edge labeled with interface names.4.3 Visualization (SLG Mode)Library: Vis.jsTheme: Hexagonal Sci-Fi / Hive.Nodes:Shape: hexagonColor Palette:Standard: Amber/Gold (#f59e0b)Firewall: Red (#ef4444)WLC: Emerald (#10b981)Core/HQ: Royal Blue (#3b82f6)Font: White, Segoe UI, heavy stroke for contrast.Edges:Style: Thick (width: 3), dark grey (#4b5563).Labels: White text on dark background badges.Physics (Organic Layout):barnesHut solver with high repulsion (-12000) to prevent overlap of large hexagonal nodes.5. Coding Standards & Conventions5.1 HTML/CSSUtility-First: Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Do not write custom CSS in <style> blocks unless absolutely necessary (e.g., scrollbar customization).Responsiveness: Use Tailwind breakpoints (md:, lg:) to ensure layout adapts to tablet and desktop.Dark Mode: The Diagram container uses a hardcoded dark background (#111827) to support the SLG aesthetic.5.2 JavaScriptES6+ Syntax: Use const/let, Arrow Functions () => {}, and Template Literals `...`.Async/Await: All file operations (FileReader) and Data Import/Export functions must use async/await.Naming Conventions:Variables: camelCase (e.g., currentDeviceIndex).Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., STORAGE_KEY).Functions: Verb-Noun (e.g., parseIOSConfig, drawDiagram).Safety:Always escape HTML when rendering user content (config files) to prevent XSS.Use try/catch blocks around JSON parsing and LocalStorage operations.6. Storage & Persistence Strategy6.1 Session PersistenceTrigger: Auto-save on file upload or deletion.Mechanism: localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(AppState.devices))Limit: Browser dependent (~5MB). Code must handle QuotaExceededError gracefully.6.2 Project PersistenceExport: Dumps AppState.devices to a .json file via Blob creation and dynamic anchor link click.Import: Reads .json via FileReader, validates array structure, and merges or replaces existing state.7. Future Roadmap (To Be Implemented)VLAN Mapping: visualize Layer 2 Spanning Tree based on VLAN database parsing.PDF Export: Generate a high-resolution PDF of the canvas.Search: Global search bar to find specific IP addresses across all loaded configs.
